# Day 7

This day was (mostly) used as an excuse to become a "certified Rockstar developer".
By implementing a solution to the first part of the problem using the [rockstar language](https://codewithrockstar.com).
The solution is quite slow (quadratic) due to missing sorting compared to the Python version.
This is due to the rockstar language being so bare bones I would have to implement my own sorting.

The `part_one.rock` file contains the source code for the rockstar solution in a non-idiomatic but indented and more readable format.
Idiomatic rockstar should look like lyrics to a ["hair metal power ballad"](https://codewithrockstar.com).
The file `idiomatic.rock` contains a more lyrical version of the (part_one) solution (although maybe not as elegant as truly idiomatic rockstar).
The lyrics are a tribute to the song "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" by Sabaton.
