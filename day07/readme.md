# Day 7

This day was (mostly) used as an excuse to become a "certified Rockstar developer".
By implementing a solution using the [rockstar language](https://codewithrockstar.com).
As a point of comparison I started with a "no libraries" version in Python for both parts of the proble,

The solution is quite slow (quadratic) due to missing sorting compared to the Python version.
This is due to the rockstar language being so bare bones I would have to implement my own sorting.
The rockstart solution also only covers the first part of the problem.

The [`part_one.rock`](part_one.rock) file contains the source code for the rockstar solution in a non-idiomatic but indented and more readable format.
Idiomatic rockstar should look like lyrics to a ["hair metal power ballad"](https://codewithrockstar.com).
The file [`idiomatic.rock`](idiomatic.rock) contains a more lyrical version of the (part_one) solution (although maybe not as elegant as truly idiomatic rockstar).
The lyrics are a tribute to the song "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" by Sabaton.
